At the time I just didn&#39;t care about haircuts so I avoided them. I just kept growing out my hair, even if it kept getting in my eyes. (link-reveal:&quot;I could still see through my hair after all.&quot;)[==

Sure, it made my sight a little fuzzier. It got harder to see things in my peripheral vision. But I just kept wearing it long because I didn&#39;t care for shorter hair. Eventually, I grew up and figured that meant cutting it off. (link-reveal:&quot;But that bit of blindness remained no matter how short my hair got.&quot;)[==

I couldn&#39;t see certain things about myself. I couldn&#39;t see myself as &quot;smart&quot; enough to enjoy working with technology. I couldn&#39;t see myself as talented enough to make art. I couldn&#39;t see how much I wanted to be a woman.

(link-reveal:&quot;But most of all...&quot;)[==

The sun&#39;s tingly warmth relaxes my soul as (link-reveal:&quot;I walk in the park.&quot;)[== 

After being cooped up indoors for such a long dark winter the smell of dirt and plants is incredibly cathartic. I get shivers down my spine as the breeze (link-reveal:&quot;rustles the leaves above me.&quot;)[==

But existing as myself, outside the house. An existance so utterly mundane and free. (link-reveal:&quot;That&#39;s what lifts my spirits the highest.&quot;)[==

And appearing form behind a bend I see the most incredible sight! (link-reveal:&quot;Yellow fur, &quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;a black nose, &quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;four legs and four paws, &quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;and a happy wagging tail.&quot;, (text-style:&quot;sway&quot;))[==

(link-reveal:&quot;It&#39;s a golden retriever!&quot;, (text-colour:yellow))[==

I beam as I see the dog trotting over towards me, as happy as they can be. Just like I am. I have to hold myself back from skipping over too, saying hi and petting them - (link-replace:&quot;I want to...&quot;)[==I want to, (link-replace:&quot;but...&quot;)[==but people make me anxious. Like the person on the other end of the leash. (link-reveal:&quot;So I just mind my business and try to look uninterested&quot;)[==

Soon the moment passes, as the dog and their owner pass by.

The owner is forgotten, but I keep thinking about their dog. I think a refrain that keeps getting stuck in my head lately.

So I&#39;ve kinda always had a hard time [[➥ understanding myself-&gt;Identity Issues]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Identity Issues" tags="Realizations" position="150,425" size="100,100">Like, my difficulty processing and understanding myself is a chronic and dire issue. Like even figuring out my gender was a long and drawn out process. For the longest time as a kid I didn&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; gender and just kinda ignored it and did my own thing. 

(link-reveal:&quot;At least until the world wouldn&#39;t let me.&quot;)[==

(link-reveal:&quot;But I guess in some ways I had some //no signs™// moments back when I was a kid.&quot;)[== I liked being friends with more girls than boys. I was envious of girl&#39;s clothes. Heck, I even fantasized about being a girl in a few embarrassing private moments. 

(link-reveal:&quot;But I never listened to those signs.&quot;)[== Heck, only a couple years ago I saw solid and undeniable proof I could be a hot and attractive trans woman. I even said, in that moment, &quot;//I// could look like that,&quot; before trying to bury those feelings deep. I fought hard against that first crack in my egg - it took over a year before I came to accept it. 

(link-reveal:&quot;Accepting I&#39;m a dog felt even harder.&quot;)[== I could grasp and map myself onto a feminine body. A feminine **human** body. But a dog was a whole different ballpark. Like, I don&#39;t even know what having a tail feels like; or what it would be like to have floppy ears. (link-reveal:&quot;Let alone acting or looking more like a dog.&quot;)[==

I can&#39;t exactly get acceptance and permission from others to act more like a dog. Let alone give it to myself.

Plus, unlike my gender, (link-reveal:&quot;there were genuinely no signs!&quot;)[== [[Suddenly, I flashed back to a memory from high school.-&gt;High School]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="High School" tags="Realizations High-School" position="150,550" size="100,100">(change: ?page, (t8n: &quot;blur&quot;))\
I&#39;m underneath the stairwell, the perfect space for hiding along with all of my other friends who didn&#39;t like to be seen.

(link-reveal:&quot;I was ignoring Goth as usual,&quot;)[== who was recruiting us to watch the new Gundam series by showing off how cool the new mech designs were. I never really cared for mechanical junk; so my selectively deaf ears did their best to make their screeds futile.

Instead, I actually found my attention (link-reveal:&quot;drifting towards Paige.&quot;)[== I... kinda had a crush on her. In retrospect, it was clearly a &quot;I want to be her&quot; crush. But then again, I still get crushes on artsy and nerdy types. You bet she was both too, considering she was the furry of the group.

(link-reveal:&quot;I managed to gather the courage to Approach Paige.&quot;)[== It was uncharacteristic of me, especially back then. I was always anxious around people, doubly so around those I liked. 

(link-reveal:&quot;\&quot;So, what are you working on?\&quot;&quot;)[== I asked her. My crush immediately started to ramble about her new mouse OC that she was drawing; and elaborated on an adventure that this new sketch was a snapshot of. I listened and nodded intently, trying to make mental notes of each detail, as if I was going to be quizzed about them later. 

Then suddenly she asked, [[➥ &quot;What&#39;s your fursona?&quot;-&gt;What&#39;s your fursona?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="What&#39;s your fursona?" tags="Realizations High-School" position="150,650" size="100,100">&quot;What&#39;s your fursona?&quot; Paige asked.

(link-replace:&quot;\&quot;Uh what?\&quot;&quot;)[==&quot;Oh, uh, no I don&#39;t have one...&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s make you one! What&#39;s your favorite animal?&quot;

(link-replace:&quot;\&quot;Wait, dogs sound boring. Uh, what sounds sound cooler...\&quot;&quot;, (t8n:&quot;fade-down&quot;))[==\
&quot;Um... Wolf dogs are pretty alright.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that makes sense! What dog breed are they? Besides wolf.&quot;

(link-replace:&quot;\&quot;Actually! A golden retriever sounds better!\&quot;&quot;, (text-colour:yellow))[==(link-replace:&quot;\&quot;Nah, she&#39;ll think I&#39;m childish if I say a goldie...\&quot;&quot;, (transition:&quot;shudder&quot;))[==[==An Irish Wolfhound sounds like it would be cool. &#39;Those who hunt monsters&#39; and all that.&quot;

&quot;Ooh! What does he look like?&quot;

(link-replace:&quot;\&quot;//She// would be a cute and fluffy little doggy with long hair!\&quot;&quot;, (text-colour:yellow))[==(link-replace:&quot;\&quot;No, I&#39;ll sound like a perv if I say that.\&quot;&quot;, (transition:&quot;shudder&quot;))[==&quot;Tall, skinny, maybe looks a bit like a bounty hunter? Like Han Solo meets Sephiroth meets Geralt. And... blonde fur and long brown hair.&quot;

[[➥ &quot;Okay! I&#39;ll draw him up real quick!&quot;-&gt;the Wolfhound]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="the Wolfhound" tags="Realizations High-School" position="150,750" size="100,100">Soon enough, (link-reveal:&quot;she came back with a sketch.&quot;)[==

It was exactly what I wanted, a competent drawing of a lithe and athletic wolfhound. Clad in a black leather jacket, and wielding a sword. I shouldn&#39;t have cared about it; I wasn&#39;t even a furry. (link-replace:&quot;But...&quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;But there was something about the sketch...&quot;)[==

The androgynous look, the long hair tied back into a ponytail, and how feral they seemed. It made me smile in a genuine way that I couldn&#39;t back then. (link-reveal:&quot;I...&quot;)[==

(link-reveal:&quot;I was proud of it.&quot;, (text-color:&quot;#c9ad7d&quot;))[== Proud that I received a gift from my crush. I excitedly went up and showed Goth. Who immediately asked, (link-reveal:&quot;\&quot;What&#39;s their name?\&quot;&quot;)[==

(link-replace:&quot;Gold.&quot;, (text-color:&quot;#c9ad7d&quot;))[==(link-reveal:&quot;Gold, the Wolfhound&quot;)[==

&quot;Yo, they sound like an edgelord dude. You hiding some edge sis?&quot; Goth joked. I didn&#39;t reply. Something like shame started boiling viscerally inside me.

I hid that sketch in my locker. But as time went on I slowly became more ashamed of it. Being a furry is childish; it&#39;s better and more mature (link-reveal:&quot;to accept your human body...&quot;)[== (link-replace:&quot;But...&quot;)[==But I couldn&#39;t bring myself to get rid of it, even though I couldn&#39;t look at it either. 

So instead I hid it away, leaving it sandwiched between unimportant documents in a yellow binder. An attempt to forget about it...

(transition-depart:&quot;instant&quot;)[[➥ ...years later-&gt;Return to the Park]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Return to the Park" tags="Realizations Park" position="275,425" size="100,100">(change: ?page, (transition:&quot;blur&quot;)+(t8n-time:2s))\
It&#39;s been a rough couple of weeks since Goth made me aware of the term (link-repeat:&quot;therian&quot;)[(dialog:&quot;Someone who identifies with another animal species from earth.&quot;)]. Since then, I&#39;ve been trying to explore what (link-reveal:&quot;being a dog means to me.&quot;)[==

The rustling plants make my floppy ears twitch, and earthly smells seem to tug gently at my snout. I can&#39;t touch them, but for some reason I can&#39;t help but notice my doglike features&#39; presence. Often feeling them stronger than my own body.

Likewise another consequence is that I&#39;ve been visiting the park more often. After all, dogs love going to the park. I guess I do too, since I feel my phantom (text-style:&quot;sway&quot;)[tail] is  wagging.

Another Golden Retriever passes by me without incident. As is ritual, I can&#39;t help but chant a painful refrain, &quot;they&#39;ll never realize that (link-replace:&quot;I&#39;m a dog too...\&quot;&quot;)[==I&#39;m a dog too.&quot;

On this occasion though, a question sneaks into my head; &quot;if I&#39;m a dog then (link-reveal:&quot;what does it mean to be a dog?\&quot;&quot;)[==

Well, there&#39;s the physical features of a dog: tails, ears, a muzzle, paws. None of which I actually have... What about the actions of a dog? Should I pant and walk on all fours? Think like a dog? Is it even possible to? All these questions make me wonder, (link-reveal:&quot;\&quot;How the heck am I a dog...\&quot;&quot;)[==

(link-reveal:&quot;\&quot;I&#39;m just a human.\&quot;&quot;)[==

Somehow the admission stings. Just like if I was called a man. I try to pull my attention elsewhere in self-preservation.

(link-replace:&quot;Questions about what I looked like...&quot;)[==|sunny&gt;[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Questions about what I looked like. When 🐶 asked questions about my form, the wolf would answered them first. And it got more upset as I corrected myself.

|twilight&gt;[Twilight | Light System]
|text&gt;[==Why do you think it&#39;s a wolf?

(link-replace:&quot;Because they said so earlier&quot;)[==|sunny&gt;[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Because they said so earlier. But the weird thing, was when I was asked about my breed, it said &quot;irish wolfhound&quot; in my head before I could think about my actual breed.
(link-reveal:&quot;But also...&quot;)[==
(link-replace:&quot;I had a wolfhound fursona...&quot;)[==I had a wolfhound fursona back in high school.

(link-reveal:&quot;But...&quot;)[== the closest to that sounds like that was I had a bit of a panic attack and my phantoms felt more like the wolfhounds... but I haven&#39;t had anything like that since.

|twilight&gt;[Twilight | Light System]
|text&gt;[==Interesting. One more thing. Have you talked to this wolfhound?

(link-replace:&quot;No&quot;)[==|sunny&gt;[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
No. Not exactly. Just, correcting it&#39;s answers to these questions.

|twilight&gt;[Twilight | Light System]

(link-replace:&quot;Not really...&quot;)[==|sunny&gt;[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Not really...
(link-reveal:&quot;So what is up with me?&quot;)[==

|twilight&gt;[Twilight | Light System]
|text&gt;[==To put it simply, you have two forms and you have some anxiety.
I have known some who have multiple concrete forms. Unlike radiant, who shifts fluidly between forms. Some even use these forms as a shield or coping mechanism.

|goth&gt;[AbandonedMallGoth]
|text&gt;[==So not a plural thing?

|twilight&gt;[Twilight | Light System]
|text&gt;[==Exactly.

(link-replace:&quot;Plural?&quot;)[==|sunny&gt;[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Plural?

|twilight&gt;[Twilight | Light System]
|text&gt;[==Sorry. I should explain.
But first, are you familiar with Disassociative Identity Disorder; or what media calls &quot;Multiple Personalities&quot;?

(link-replace:&quot;Um yes?&quot;)[==|sunny&gt;[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Um yes?

|twilight&gt;[Twilight | Light System]
|text&gt;[==Plurality is an umbrella term for similar situations. Where two individuals with agency exist within the same body. Which is called a &quot;system&quot;. Since the members work together to create a functioning &quot;individual&quot;.
Penumbra and myself are one such example. She is a close friend and a person whom I consider a kind of family.
I had a suspicion that you might be plural too. However as it stands there is not enough to indicate that this is plurality.

(link-replace:&quot;So what is it then???&quot;)[==|sunny&gt;[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
So what is it then???

|twilight&gt;[Twilight | Light System]
|text&gt;[==You said you inhabited your wolfhound form when you were scared. Right?

(link-replace:&quot;Mhm&quot;)[==|sunny&gt;[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Mhm

|goth&gt;[AbandonedMallGoth]
|text&gt;[==Weird thing though
What if it&#39;s their old fursona?

|twilight&gt;[Twilight | Light System]
|text&gt;[==Still.
I do not think that Sunny is plural.
They haven&#39;t talked and likewise the wolf has not shown agency.
She was anxious when she joined, and that got expressed in her form.

(link-reveal:&quot;\&quot;So... I&#39;m just a wolfhound sometimes,\&quot;&quot;)[== the thought keeps nagging at me as I circle the park once again...

It&#39;s been unsatisfying. Just having this part of me that&#39;s caused distress to be just a coping mechanism.

But on the other hand it means I&#39;m flexible with who I am! Some days I can feel like a cute fluffy puppy! But other days I&#39;m a big strong wolf who can protect herself from (link-reveal:&quot;the world!&quot;)[==

Focusing on that last word reminds me, to once again meditate on the world as I walk through the park...

(link-reveal:&quot;I smell the dirt and perfume of the plants... &quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;I hear the leaves dancing and the birds singing... &quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;I feel the dirt and gravel shift under my paws... &quot;)[==And I feel my ears, twitching with sounds, my (text-style:&quot;sway&quot;)[tail swaying] with each step, and my muzzle on the front of my face.

All of them golden and fluffy...

I haven&#39;t felt the wolfhound form, or heard it talk, in the days since I talked with Twilight. Another aspect of that anti-climax. I suppose that I haven&#39;t needed a strong form as I have gotten more comfortable in my skin. Likewise haven&#39;t felt as anxious or scared since either...

(link-reveal:&quot;Since I&#39;m a happy little puppy after all!&quot;)[==

Talking on Frogs has made it more comfortable to embrace aspects of myself. I&#39;ve picked up mannerisms from 🐶, and have gotten lots of validating headpats and belly rubs from the group there!

I&#39;ve even ordered a set of ears and a collar to help me feel more like a puppy in my skin!

At the moment though, I&#39;m just pretending to be human. (link-reveal:&quot;I&#39;m doing a pretty dang good job looking the part too!&quot;)[== 

The folks on Frogs have helped a lot with my transition and presentation. I learned a lot about makeup from Twilight and company. 🐶 helped with finding flattering clothes that make me look like I actually have curves. I feel like I&#39;m no longer flailing trying to look like a woman.

A thought strikes me when (link-reveal:&quot;I see a bathroom up ahead.&quot;)[== &quot;I feel amazing! I look amazing! I think I can do it.

It all goes quiet. The thoughts, the anxiety, the panic attack. 

(link-reveal:&quot;Until a nearby stall door slams shut&quot;)[==

I sink into the toilet, calming as (link-reveal:&quot;I ground myself.&quot;)[==

(link:&quot;I smell the cleaning chemicals lingering in this bathroom... &quot;)[==(link:&quot;I hear the steady drip of a leaking faucet...&quot;)[==(link:&quot;I feel my claws gripping into my leg...&quot;)[==And I feel my ears standing alert, my tail hanging off the edge of the toilet, and my muzzle bearing fangs.

The second I return to the safety of the park, I nearly collapse. I am drained and exhausted by that aborted panic attack.

(link-reveal:&quot;Twilight&quot;)[==
(link-reveal:&quot;Do you think I&#39;m plural?&quot;)[==

|twilight&gt;[Twilight | Light System]
|text&gt;[==I can&#39;t say.
But there is [[➥ one more thing-&gt;Meditation]] I would suggest.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Meditation" tags="Unification Meditation" position="575,50" size="100,100">I close the curtains in my room. Make it as dark as possible. I put on some rhythmless new age music.

I start with Twilight&#39;s first instruction (link-reveal:&quot;\&quot;Remove as much stimulation in your room\&quot;&quot;)[==

Then I place myself in a chair, and relax (link-reveal:&quot;\&quot;Relax as much of your body as you can. Every muscle and inch of your body.\&quot;&quot;)[==

I imagine my body relaxing into a warm bath. Every inch of my body relieving itself from the burden of holding tension as it&#39;s immersed into the fantasized body of water.(link:&quot; My feet...&quot;)[==(link:&quot; My legs...&quot;)[==(link:&quot; My torso...&quot;)[==(link:&quot; My arms and shoulders...&quot;)[==(link:&quot; Even my jaw and eyebrows...&quot;)[==..

Every part of my body perfectly relaxed. Feeling weightless. Like my vessel hardly exists now, prepared for losing myself into the next step. (link-replace:&quot;\&quot;To create a mindspace...\&quot;&quot;)[==&quot;To create a mindspace.&quot;

According to Twilight, a mindspace is a kind of mental image of a space to exist and live in. A peaceful home made perfectly to my needs and specification, what would be called a &quot;happy place&quot; in a cliche visualization exercise. 

[[➥ I begin with a forest-&gt;the Mindspace]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="the Mindspace" tags="Unification Meditation" position="575,150" size="100,100">(change: ?page, (background:&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corlesss/dogs_story/main/dist/img/night%20forest.jpg&quot;)+(t8n:&quot;blur&quot;))\
I visualize a thick forest. Filled with pine trees, and a sparse underbrush. A creek echoes into the air along with the idle sounds of birds and insects. Singing to night, illuminated by countless stars and the beautiful moon watching over all.

(link-reveal:&quot;However, it&#39;s still not appropriate for a domesticated Golden Retriever.&quot;)[==
(change: ?page, (background:&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corlesss/dogs_story/main/dist/img/night%20cabin.jpg&quot;)+(t8n:&quot;dissolve&quot;))\

I begin on a small clearing, within earshot of the nearby creek, and begin a shell of a small home. Lots of windows and skylights to help diminish the barrier between inside and out. (link-reveal:&quot;The first thing I populate it with is a fireplace &quot;)[==

(change: ?page, (background:&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corlesss/dogs_story/main/dist/img/night%20fireplace.jpeg&quot;)+(t8n:&quot;dissolve&quot;))\
And next to the fireplace is a dog bed to curl up in next to it. I vaguely decorate the rest of the space with vague images of a kitchen, bathroom, hallways. It is unneeded as it is, and I instead (link-replace:&quot;focus on the bedroom in the loft...&quot;)[==\
(change: ?page, (background:&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corlesss/dogs_story/main/dist/img/night%20bedroom.jpg&quot;)+(t8n:&quot;dissolve&quot;))\
focus on the bedroom in the loft.

It seems... appropriate that I would attempt the next step within a metaphor for the most private part of my mind. 

I make my room as comfortable a resting space as possible; so a wonderful place to start is a cozy little bed illuminated by fairy lights hung across the ceiling. A closet filled with affirming clothings. Likewise a tiny desk with a small but powerful PC.

The next step is what causes me the most pause. [[➥ I have to inhabit this space next...-&gt;Inhabiting]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Inhabiting" tags="Unification Meditation Bedroom" position="575,250" size="100,100">(set:$dog to 0)\

We talked about a lot.

Our theory is that we have two different roles in regard to ourself. That Gold&#39;s purpose was to keep us safe, act as a protector, and watch out for danger. Meanwhile Sunny was responsible for helping us reach out and help us express ourself more openly. 

(link-reveal:&quot;We also tried to puzzle out how long each of us have been here...&quot;, (text-color:&quot;yellow&quot;))[==

It feels, in a sense, that we have always both been around. From high school we distinctly remember moments involving the two of us. But likewise, we felt very intertwined in personality. But our dog forms just created enough cognitive dissonance to cause fracturing; and cause us to finally split.

(text-color:&quot;#c9ad7d&quot;)+(t8n-depart:&quot;instant&quot;)+(t8n-arrive:&quot;dissolve&quot;)[[[➥ So about that...-&gt;One last walk]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="One last walk" tags="Park" position="925,50" size="100,100">(change: ?page, (transition:&quot;dissolve&quot;)+(t8n-time:2s))\
(link-reveal:&quot;Sunlight. &quot;, (text-colour:#ffe066))[==It&#39;s tingly warmth relaxes our very soul as (link-reveal:&quot;we walk through this park!&quot;, (text-colour:&quot;yellow&quot;))[== 

Our walks have become the perfect time for us to talk now! We talk about people! The people we like! Drama on Twitter! Each other! lots of stuffs!

But likewise it&#39;s made us prone to contemplation. Thinking about complicated things. Like... (link-reveal:&quot;my gender. &quot;, (text-colour:#ffe066))[==

Honestly, it was easier figuring out that I&#39;m a dog than my fucking gender. I&#39;m a wolfhound, that was so easy (link-repeat:&quot;I could figure it out in high school.&quot;, (text-colour:#ffe066))[(text-color:yellow)(dialog:&quot;Yet you were too much of a coward that you gave up on that as soon as somebody made fun of you. :P&quot;)] But what the hell kinda gender I have is just... complicated. Doesn&#39;t help that gender is a concept created by humans, and I&#39;m not a human. Even if that was hard for us to admit not that ago.

(link-reveal:&quot;But I made easier for you to be a dog! &quot;, (text-colour:yellow))[==I&#39;ve been forcing Gold to finally dress like the goth pup they are! It&#39;s helped them feel more comfy wearing their collar outside! Plus they feel intimidating! Plus we learned some hair buns that make us feel like we got ears! 

(link-replace:&quot;Still...&quot;, (text-colour:#ffe066))[==Still, I have no clue how to map a gender like me. At least with Sunny she&#39;s happy being a &quot;good girl&quot; or whatever. Me? It feels like my gender is just &quot;dog&quot; and how the heck do I map that onto me?

(link-reveal:&quot;Gold! Shut up and look up!&quot;, (text-colour:&quot;yellow&quot;))[==

...and appearing behind a bend we see the most heavenly sight. (link-reveal:&quot;Yellow fur, &quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;a black nose, &quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;four legs (each ending in paws), &quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;and a happy wagging tail.&quot;, (text-style:&quot;sway&quot;))[==

(link-reveal:&quot;It&#39;s a golden retriever.&quot;, (text-colour:#ffe066))[==

We beam as I see the dog walk in our direction. As happy as they can be. Our gaze is transfixed. Just watching the goldie come closer, (link-reveal:&quot;until...&quot;)[==

They dart towards us and starts sniffing us, with an excited wagging tail! Their owner shouts an embarrassed, &quot;sorry!&quot; Trying to drag the dog away! But they&#39;re too transfixed with our scent. (link-reveal:&quot;We give a brief glance to the person at the other end of the leash.&quot;)[== (link-reveal:&quot;//Oh//&quot;, (text-colour:#ffe066))[== they&#39;re a fucking hot enby with blue hair, wearing a denim jacket covered in pride pins, and a collar around their neck too.

&quot;Oh, she&#39;s not usually this friendly with people.&quot; 

(link-reveal:&quot;We should ask to pet her!&quot;, (text-colour:&quot;yellow&quot;))[==
(link-reveal:&quot;Gah... gay...&quot;, (text-colour:#ffe066))[==
(link-reveal:&quot;Okay you useless lesbian!&quot;, (text-colour:&quot;yellow&quot;))[==

(link-reveal:&quot;\&quot;Um, is it okay if I pet her?\&quot;&quot;, (text-colour:&quot;yellow&quot;))[== We asked.

&quot;Oh, of course. She really seems to like you. She&#39;s usually only this friendly with dogs!&quot;
