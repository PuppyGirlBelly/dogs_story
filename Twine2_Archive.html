(link-reveal:&quot;Goth was there too,&quot;)[== proselytizing the new Gundam Series. Convincing us to watch by showing how cool the mech designs of this series is. I never really cared about mechs or mechanical designs; so my deaf ears did their best to make their screeds futile.

Instead, I actually found my attention drifting towards (link-reveal:&quot;Paige.&quot;)[== I... kinda had a crush on her. In retrospect, it was clearly a &quot;I want to be her&quot; crush. But then again, I still get crushes on artsy and nerdy types. You bet she was both too, considering she was the furry of the group. 

In an unusual act of boldness, I managed to gather the courage to ask her what she was working on. As usual it was her mouse OC, and started rambling about the adventure this sketch was portraying. I listened and nodded intently, trying to note details as if there was a test later about them. Until suddently...

It was exactly what I wanted, a competent drawing of lithe and athletic wolfhound. Clad in a black leather jacket, and weilding a sword. I shouldn&#39;t have cared about it; I wasn&#39;t even a furry. (link-replace:&quot;But...&quot;)[==But something about the sketch... The androgynous look, the long hair tied back into a ponytail, and how feral they looked. It made me smile in a genuine way that I couldn&#39;t back then.

(link-reveal:&quot;I was proud of it&quot;)[==, and I showed Goth. They laughed at how edgy they looked, and I felt silly. But then asked what&#39;s my new OC&#39;s (link:&quot;name...&quot;)[==name.

I kept that sketch in my locker, proud that I had some art of my crush that they drew for me. But as time went on I slowly became more ashamed of it. Being a furry was childish. It&#39;s better to accept whom you are, more mature... (link-reveal:&quot;but...&quot;)[== I couldn&#39;t bring myself to get rid of it, I couldn&#39;t look at it either. 

Instead I just hidden it away, slid away in with important documents. In an attempt to forget about it...

In comparison, gender was easy. I could see a girl, and map myself onto her. I could look and act more like a girl, and it is (relatively) socially acceptable. Ultimately, I could give permission to myself to become more like a girl. 

But something other than human is much (link-reveal:&quot;harder to grasp...&quot;)[==

Until that moment, I couldn&#39;t conceptually map a tail and muzzle onto me the same way I could with breasts. I couldn&#39;t act like a dog without people thinking I should be locked up.

I would like to ask about this wolfhound you mentioned.
Has it ever talked?

Why do you think it&#39;s an Irish Wolfhound?

(link-replace:&quot;Because I was them&quot;)[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Because I was them, for a moment. A couple of weeks ago I was in the park and got spooked for some reason... and I took a look at my phantoms. But instead of the usual puppy I saw a wolfhound instead...

(transition:&quot;fade-up&quot;)+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Interesting... one more thing. Has this wolfhound talked to you directly?

(link-replace:&quot;No&quot;)[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
No. Not exactly. Just, expressing my anxieties and answering questions.

(transition:&quot;fade-up&quot;)+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Hm. 
I see.

(link-replace:&quot;So what is up with me?&quot;)[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
So what is up with me?

(transition:&quot;fade-up&quot;)+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
To put it simply, you have two forms and you have to process some anxiety.
I have known some who have multiple concrete forms. Unlike radient, who shifts fluidly between forms.

(transition:&quot;fade-up&quot;)[==(text-colour:#f5376a)[AbandonedMallGoth]
So not a plural thing

(transition:&quot;fade-up&quot;)+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Exactly.

(link-replace:&quot;Plural?&quot;)[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Plural?

(transition:&quot;fade-up&quot;)+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Sorry. I should explain.
But first, are you familiar with Dissasociative Identity Disorder; or what media calls &quot;Multiple Personalities&quot;?

(link-replace:&quot;Um yes?&quot;)[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Um yes?

(transition:&quot;fade-up&quot;)+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Plurality is an umbrella term for similar situations. Where two actors with agency exist within the same body.
Penumbra and myself are one such example. Penumbra is a younger sister to me whom just happens to coexist with me inside my head.
I had a suspicion that this might be the case. However as it stands there is not enough to indicate that this is plurality.

(link-replace:&quot;So what is it then???&quot;)[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
So what is it then???

(transition:&quot;fade-up&quot;)+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
You said you inhabited your wolfhound form when you were scared. Right?

(link-replace:&quot;Mhm&quot;)[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Mhm

(transition:&quot;fade-up&quot;)+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Could be merely that you preferred a more intimidating form to protect yourself; and reverted when you were safe.

(transition:&quot;fade-up&quot;)[==(text-colour:#f5376a)[AbandonedMallGoth]
Weird thing though
Sunny&#39;s old fursona back when we were in high school
It was a wolfhound too

(transition:&quot;fade-up&quot;)+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Oh.
Still.
I don&#39;t think that Sunny is plural like I am.

[[➥ So I&#39;m just a wolfhound sometimes?-&gt;Puppy in the Park]]
]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Puppy in the Park" tags="Realizations Park" position="625,400" size="100,100">(link-reveal:&quot;So... I&#39;m just a wolfhound sometimes,&quot;)[== is a thought that nags at me as I circle the park once again...

It&#39;s been unsatisfying. Just having this part of me that&#39;s caused distress to be just a coping mechanism.

But on the other hand it means I&#39;m flexible with who I am! Some days I can feel like a cute fluffy puppy! But others I&#39;m a wolf who protects themselves from (link-reveal:&quot;the world!&quot;)[==

Focusing on that last word reminds me, to once again meditate on the world as I walk through the park...

(link:&quot;I smell the dirt and ichor of the plants... &quot;)[==(link:&quot;I hear the leaves dancing and the birds singing...&quot;)[==(link:&quot;I feel the dirt and gravel shift under my paws...&quot;)[==And I feel my ears, twitching with sounds, my tail swaying with each step, and my muzzle on the front of my face.

All of them golden and fluffy...

I haven&#39;t felt the wolfhound form, or heard it talk, in the days since I talked with Twilight. Another aspect of that anti-climax. I suppose that I haven&#39;t needed a strong form as I have gotten more comfortable in my skin. Likewise haven&#39;t felt as anxious or scared since either...

(link-reveal:&quot;Since I&#39;m a happy little puppy after all!&quot;)[==

Talking on Frogs has made it more comfortable to embrace aspects of myself. I&#39;ve picked up mannerisms from 🐶, and have gotten lots of validating headpats and belly rubs from the group there!

I&#39;ve even ordered a set of ears and a collar to help me feel more like a puppy in my skin!

At the moment though, I&#39;m just pretending to be human. (link-reveal:&quot;I&#39;m doing a pretty dang good job looking the part too!&quot;)[== 

The folks on Frogs have helped a lot with my transition and presentation. I learned a lot about makeup from Penumbra and company. 🐶 helped with finding flattering clothes that make me look like I actually have curves. I feel like I&#39;m no longer flailing trying to look like a woman.

A thought strikes me when [[➥ I see a bathroom up ahead-&gt;the Bathroom]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="the Bathroom" tags="Realizations Park" position="625,525" size="100,100">I&#39;m feel amazing! I look amazing! I think I can do it. (link-reveal:&quot;\&quot;I&#39;m finally going to use the ladies room!\&quot;&quot;)[==

(link-reveal:&quot;I step inside...&quot;)[==

(link-replace:&quot;It&#39;s...&quot;)[==It&#39;s surprisingly normal. Just... a lot more stalls. And a lot more... (link-reveal:&quot;tense.&quot;)[==

My enthusiasm is replaced with (link-repeat:&quot;anxiety&quot;)[(dialog:&quot;I don&#39;t belong here&quot;)]. I silently glide towards the nearest stall, and (link-repeat:&quot;hide inside&quot;)[(dialog:&quot;What if somebody comes in and harasses me?&quot;)]. I just try to do my business quickly. Got in, get out. (link-repeat:&quot;Be done with this ASAP.&quot;)[(dialog:&quot;Oh god they&#39;re gonna see I&#39;m a man can&#39;t they?&quot;)]

(link:&quot;I hear footsteps.&quot;)[==(dialog:&quot;Oh fuck what if they see me?&quot;)\
(link:&quot;They&#39;re coming towards the stalls.&quot;)[==(dialog:&quot;I can&#39;t do this! this was a bad fucking idea!&quot;)\
(link:&quot;My breathing grows faster&quot;)[==(dialog:&quot;Oh shit oh fuck oh shit oh fuck&quot;) [[&quot;I don&#39;t want to be here&quot;-&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll take over&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="&quot;I&#39;ll take over&quot;" tags="Realizations Park" position="625,650" size="100,100">(link:&quot;\&quot;I&#39;ll take over\&quot;&quot;, (align:&quot;=&gt;&lt;=&quot;)+(box:&quot;X=&quot;)+(text-size:3))[== \
It all goes quiet. The thoughts, the anxiety, the panic attack. 

(link-reveal:&quot;Until a stall door opens and slams&quot;)[==

I sink into the toilet, calming as (link-reveal:&quot;I ground myself.&quot;)[==

(link:&quot;I smell the cleaning chemicals lingering in this bathroom... &quot;)[==(link:&quot;I hear the steady drip of a leaking faucet...&quot;)[==(link:&quot;I feel my claws gripping into my leg...&quot;)[==And I feel my ears standing alert, my tail hanging off the edge of the toilet, and my muzzle bearing fangs.

All covered in wiry hair, hanging off of a lanky and very tall body.

(link-reveal:&quot;I&#39;m a wolfhound.&quot;)[== I&#39;m strong. I&#39;m brave. And it is her who is trespassing on my territory. But I shall wait until it is (link:&quot;safe.&quot;)[==

(link:&quot;I listen to her flush a nearby toilet.&quot;)[==(link:&quot;Slam the door once more.&quot;)[==(link:&quot;Wash her hands at the sink.&quot;)[==(link:&quot;Then walk out.&quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;And then I am alone once more.&quot;)[==

I work on instinct, quickly finishing up and cleaning before anybody else has a chance to sneak up on me. Before leaving.

The second I return to the safety of the park, I nearly collapse. I am drained and exhausted by that aborted panic attack. I force myself back home, retreating to my den to recover. But still as I walk I can&#39;t help but contemplate on those words that popped into my head.

&quot;I&#39;ll take over&quot;
