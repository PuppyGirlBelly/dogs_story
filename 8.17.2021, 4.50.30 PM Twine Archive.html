The smell of plants and dirt is heavenly after a long dark winter keeping me cooped up indoors. I get shivers down my spine as I heard the leaves rustling in the (link-reveal:&quot;trees.&quot;)[==

The harmony of the leaves makes a bassline to accompany the bird calls dancing in the air. All driven by the bassline of my feet crunching the gravel on this (link-reveal:&quot;path.&quot;)[==

But the moment passes, as the dog and their owner pass by me.

The moment is clouded by the same thought I always have with moments like these.

[[➥ They&#39;ll never know that...-&gt;Title Drop]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="High School" tags="Realizations" position="325,625" size="100,100">Suddenly, I flashed back to a memory from (link:&quot;high school.&quot;)[==

I&#39;m underneath the stairwell, the perfect space for hiding along with all of my friends who didn&#39;t like to be seen.

(link-reveal:&quot;Goth was there too&quot;)[==, proselytizing the new Gundam Series. Convincing us to watch by showing how cool the mech designs of this series is. I never really cared about mechs or mechanical designs; so my deaf ears did their best to make their screeds futile.

Instead, I actually found my attention drifting towards (link-reveal:&quot;Paige.&quot;)[== I... kinda had a crush on her. In retrospect, it was clearly a &quot;I want to be her&quot; crush. But then again, I still get crushes on artsy and nerdy types. You bet she was both too, considering she was the furry of the group. 

In an unusual act of boldness, I managed to gather the courage to ask her what she was working on. As usual it was her mouse OC, and started rambling about the adventure this sketch was portraying. I listened and nodded intently, trying to note details as if there was a test later about them. Until suddently...

(link-replace:&quot;Olive...&quot;)[==Gold, the Wolfhound

I kept that sketch in my locker, proud that I had some art of my crush that they drew for me. But as time went on I slowly became more ashamed of it. Being a furry was childish. It&#39;s better to accept whom you are, more mature... (link-reveal:&quot;but...&quot;)[== I couldn&#39;t bring myself to get rid of it, I couldn&#39;t look at it either. 

Instead I just hidden it away, slid away in with important documents. In an attempt to forget about it...

In comparison, gender was easy. I could see a girl, and map myself onto her. I could look and act more like a girl, and it is (relatively) socially acceptable. Ultimately, I could give permission to myself to become more like a girl. 

But something other than human is much (link-reveal:&quot;harder to grasp...&quot;)[==

Until that moment, I couldn&#39;t conceptually map a tail and muzzle onto me the same way I could with breasts. I couldn&#39;t act like a dog without people thinking I should be locked up.

It makes an extremely effective downer. So good I kinda couldn&#39;t feel anything for like 13 years. Plus! It tends to have a lot of reality altering effects!

Like making me blind to how I am a girl, or making me think I didn&#39;t enjoy or was smart enough to work with computers. Also, how... well...

The smell of plants and dirt is heavenly after a long dark winter keeping me cooped up indoors. I get shivers down my spine as I heard the leaves rustling in the (link-reveal:&quot;trees.&quot;)[==

The harmony of the leaves makes a bassline to accompany the bird calls dancing in the air. All driven by the bassline of my feet crunching the gravel on this (link-reveal:&quot;path.&quot;)[==

And appearing behind a bend I see the most heavenly sight. (link-reveal:&quot;Yellow fur, &quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;a black nose, &quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;four legs (each ending in paws), &quot;)[==(link-reveal:&quot;and a happy wagging tail.&quot;, (text-style:&quot;sway&quot;))[==

I beam as I see the dog walk in my direction. As happy as they can be. There&#39;s a (text-style:&quot;buoy&quot;)[bounce] in my skip. I so desperately want to meet them, say hi, get to know them. (link-reveal:&quot;I want to...&quot;)[==

But the moment passes, as the dog and their owner pass by me.

The moment is clouded by the same thought I always have with moments like these.
