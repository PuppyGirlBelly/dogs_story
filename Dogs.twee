:: Introduction [Intro] {"position":"0,0","size":"100,100"}
Dysphoria is hell of a drug.

It makes an extremely effective downer. So good I kinda couldn't feel anything for like 13 years. Plus! It tends to have a lot of reality altering effects!

Like making me blind to how I am a girl, or making me think I didn't enjoy or was smart enough to work with computers. Also, how... well...

(link-reveal:"Sunlight. ")[=It's tingly warmth relaxes my very soul as I walk through this (link-reveal:"park.")[== 

The smell of plants and dirt is heavenly after a long dark winter keeping me cooped up indoors. I get shivers down my spine as I heard the leaves rustling in the (link-reveal:"trees.")[==

The harmony of the leaves makes a bass line to accompany the bird calls dancing in the air. All driven by the rhythm of my feet crunching the gravel on this (link-reveal:"path.")[==

And appearing behind a bend I see the most heavenly sight. (link-reveal:"Yellow fur, ")[==(link-reveal:"a black nose, ")[==(link-reveal:"four legs (each ending in paws), ")[==(link-reveal:"and a happy wagging tail.", (text-style:"sway"))[==

(link-reveal:"It's a golden retriever.")[==

I beam as I see the dog walk in my direction. As happy as they can be. There's a (text-style:"buoy")[bounce] in my skip. I so desperately want to meet them, say hi, get to know them. (link-reveal:"I want to...")[==

But the moment passes, as the dog and their owner pass by me.

The moment is clouded by the same thought I always have with moments like these.

(link-reveal:"Goth was there too,")[== proselytizing the new Gundam Series. Convincing us to watch by showing how cool the mech designs of this series is. I never really cared about mechs or mechanical designs; so my deaf ears did their best to make their screeds futile.

Instead, I actually found my attention drifting towards (link-reveal:"Paige.")[== I... kinda had a crush on her. In retrospect, it was clearly a "I want to be her" crush. But then again, I still get crushes on artsy and nerdy types. You bet she was both too, considering she was the furry of the group. 

In an unusual act of boldness, I managed to gather the courage to ask her what she was working on. As usual it was her mouse OC, and started rambling about the adventure this sketch was portraying. I listened and nodded intently, trying to note details as if there was a test later about them. Until suddenly...

[[➥ "Do you have a fursona?"->Do you have a fursona?]]

Soon enough, she came back with a (link:"sketch.")[==

(link-replace:"But...")[==But something about the sketch... The androgynous look, the long hair tied back into a ponytail, and how feral they looked.

I kept that sketch in my locker, proud that I had some art of my crush that they drew for me. But as time went on I slowly became more ashamed of it. Being a furry was childish. It's better to accept whom you are, more mature... (link-reveal:"but...")[== I couldn't bring myself to get rid of it, I couldn't look at it either. 

Instead I just hidden it away, slid away in with important documents. In an attempt to forget about it...

:: Identity Issues [Realizations] {"position":"0,525","size":"100,100"}
Though, in retrospect, realizing I was a dog was a larger shift for me than realizing my (link-reveal:"gender.")[==

In comparison, gender was easy. I could see a girl, and map myself onto her. I could look and act more like a girl, and it is (relatively) socially acceptable. Ultimately, I could give permission to myself to become more like a girl. 

But something other than human is much (link-reveal:"harder to grasp...")[==

Until that moment, I couldn't conceptually map a tail and muzzle onto me the same way I could with breasts. I couldn't act like a dog without people thinking I should be locked up. Fuck, I couldn't take drugs or wear clothes to look more like a dog! And people couldn't see me as a dog the same way they saw me as a woman(link:"...")[==.

It's been a rough couple of weeks since Goth made me aware of the term (link-repeat:"therian")[(dialog:"Basically, you identify strongly with another species that exists on earth.")]. Since then, I've been trying to explore what (link-reveal:"being a dog means to me.")[==

A consequence is that I've been visiting the park more often. It's what dogs enjoy, right? Going to the park.

Another Golden Retriever passes by me without incident. As ritual, I can't help but chant a painful refrain, "they'll never realize that (link-replace:"I'm a dog too...\"")[==I'm a dog too."

A question sneaks into my head; "if I'm a dog then (link-reveal:"what does it mean to be a dog?\"")[==

I think about the physical features of a dog; and how my body lacks them. What about the actions of a dog? Should I pant and walk on all fours? What about the thoughts of a dog? Can I think like a dog? All these questions create painful stabs of doubt, (link-reveal:"\"I'm not a dog...\"")[==

I keep trying to focus on the one reminder; the thing that acts as a reminder of what I am. What I look like in my mind's eye.

It's been easiest to think on my (link-repeat:"phantoms")[(dialog:"'Phantom' sensations of body parts you don't have. Things like cat ears, dragon tails, multiple arms.

Hello.
I wish that we met under better circumstances.
But regardless, it seems that you are in a bit of a tricky situation.

(link-replace:"Um Hi?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Um Hi? Sorry who are you?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
I am a friend. Penumbra has stepped away so that I can talk instead.

(link-replace:"So, um, like a friend of Penny's?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
So, um, like a friend of Penny's? And you're borrowing her account?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
More akin to family, but that's an accurate assessment.
I would like to ask about this wolfhound you mentioned.
Has it ever talked?

(link-replace:"Kinda? More like intrusive thoughts.")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Kinda, more like intrusive thoughts...

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Can you give an example of what these intrusive thoughts sounded like?

(link-replace:"Hm... it answered questions before me.")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Hm... it answered questions before me. Which I corrected immediately afterwards.

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
What sort of questions were these?

(link-replace:"Questions about what I looked like.")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Questions about what I looked like. Specifically the questions 🐶 was asking when I introduced myself here.
(link-replace:"Answering before I could...")[==Answering them before I could think, and it got more upset as I corrected myself.

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Why do you think it's an Irish Wolfhound?

(link-replace:"Because I was them")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Because I was them, for a moment. A couple of weeks ago I was in the park and got spooked for some reason... and I took a look at my phantoms. But instead of the usual puppy I saw a wolfhound instead...

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Interesting... one more thing. Has this wolfhound talked to you directly?

(link-replace:"No")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
No. Not exactly. Just, expressing my anxieties and answering questions.

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Hm. 
I see.

(link-replace:"So what is up with me?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
So what is up with me?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
To put it simply, you have two forms and you have to process some anxiety.
I have known some who have multiple concrete forms. Unlike radiant, who shifts fluidly between forms.

(transition:"fade-up")[==(text-colour:#f5376a)[AbandonedMallGoth]
So not a plural thing

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Exactly.

(link-replace:"Plural?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Plural?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Sorry. I should explain.
But first, are you familiar with Disassociative Identity Disorder; or what media calls "Multiple Personalities"?

(link-replace:"Um yes?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Um yes?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Plurality is an umbrella term for similar situations. Where two actors with agency exist within the same body.
Penumbra and myself are one such example. She is a close friend and a person whom I consider a kind of family.
I had a suspicion that this might be the case. However as it stands there is not enough to indicate that this is plurality.

(link-replace:"So what is it then???")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
So what is it then???

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
You said you inhabited your wolfhound form when you were scared. Right?

(link-replace:"Mhm")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Mhm

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Could be merely that you preferred a more intimidating form to protect yourself; and reverted when you were safe.

(transition:"fade-up")[==(text-colour:#f5376a)[AbandonedMallGoth]
Weird thing though
Sunnys old fursona back when we were in high school
It was a wolfhound too

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Oh.
Still.
I don't think that Sunny is plural like I am.

[[➥ So I'm just a wolfhound sometimes?->Puppy in the Park]]
]]


:: Puppy in the Park [Realizations Park] {"position":"625,400","size":"100,100"}
(link-reveal:"So... I'm just a wolfhound sometimes,")[== is a thought that nags at me as I circle the park once again...

It's been unsatisfying. Just having this part of me that's caused distress to be just a coping mechanism.

But on the other hand it means I'm flexible with who I am! Some days I can feel like a cute fluffy puppy! But others I'm a wolf who protects themselves from (link-reveal:"the world!")[==

Focusing on that last word reminds me, to once again meditate on the world as I walk through the park...

(link:"I smell the dirt and ichor of the plants... ")[==(link:"I hear the leaves dancing and the birds singing...")[==(link:"I feel the dirt and gravel shift under my paws...")[==And I feel my ears, twitching with sounds, my tail swaying with each step, and my muzzle on the front of my face.

All of them golden and fluffy...

I haven't felt the wolfhound form, or heard it talk, in the days since I talked with Twilight. Another aspect of that anti-climax. I suppose that I haven't needed a strong form as I have gotten more comfortable in my skin. Likewise haven't felt as anxious or scared since either...

(link-reveal:"Since I'm a happy little puppy after all!")[==

Talking on Frogs has made it more comfortable to embrace aspects of myself. I've picked up mannerisms from 🐶, and have gotten lots of validating headpats and belly rubs from the group there!

I've even ordered a set of ears and a collar to help me feel more like a puppy in my skin!

At the moment though, I'm just pretending to be human. (link-reveal:"I'm doing a pretty dang good job looking the part too!")[== 

The folks on Frogs have helped a lot with my transition and presentation. I learned a lot about makeup from Twilight and company. 🐶 helped with finding flattering clothes that make me look like I actually have curves. I feel like I'm no longer flailing trying to look like a woman.

A thought strikes me when [[➥ I see a bathroom up ahead->the Bathroom]]


:: the Bathroom [Realizations Park] {"position":"625,525","size":"100,100"}
I'm feel amazing! I look amazing! I think I can do it. (link-reveal:"\"I'm finally going to use the ladies room!\"")[==

(link-reveal:"I step inside...")[==

(link-replace:"It's...")[==It's surprisingly normal. Just... a lot more stalls. And a lot more... (link-reveal:"tense.")[==

My enthusiasm is replaced with (link-repeat:"anxiety")[(dialog:"I don't belong here")]. I silently glide towards the nearest stall, and (link-repeat:"hide inside")[(dialog:"What if somebody comes in and harasses me?")]. I just try to do my business quickly. Got in, get out. (link-repeat:"Be done with this ASAP.")[(dialog:"Oh god they're gonna see I'm a man can't they?")]

(link:"I hear footsteps.")[==(dialog:"Oh fuck what if they see me?")\
(link:"They're coming towards the stalls.")[==(dialog:"I can't do this! This was a bad fucking idea!")\

(link:"\"I'll take over\"", (align:"=><=")+(box:"X=")+(text-size:3))[== \
It all goes quiet. The thoughts, the anxiety, the panic attack. 

(link-reveal:"Until a stall door opens and slams")[==

I sink into the toilet, calming as (link-reveal:"I ground myself.")[==

(link:"I smell the cleaning chemicals lingering in this bathroom... ")[==(link:"I hear the steady drip of a leaking faucet...")[==(link:"I feel my claws gripping into my leg...")[==And I feel my ears standing alert, my tail hanging off the edge of the toilet, and my muzzle bearing fangs.

All covered in wiry hair, hanging off of a lanky and very tall body.

(link-reveal:"I'm a wolfhound.")[== I'm strong. I'm brave. And it is her who is trespassing on my territory. But I shall wait until it is (link:"safe.")[==

(link:"I listen to her flush a nearby toilet.")[==(link:"Slam the door once more.")[==(link:"Wash her hands at the sink.")[==(link:"Then walk out.")[==(link-reveal:"And then I am alone once more.")[==

I work on instinct, quickly finishing up and cleaning before anybody else has a chance to sneak up on me. Before leaving.

The second I return to the safety of the park, I nearly collapse. I am drained and exhausted by that aborted panic attack. I force myself back home, retreating to my den to recover. But still as I walk I can't help but contemplate on those words that popped into my head.

"I'll take over"

But here is [[➥ one more thing->Meditation]] I would suggest.
]]


:: Meditation [Unification Meditation] {"position":"750,0","size":"100,100"}
I close the curtains in my room. Make it as dark as possible. I put on some rhythmless new age music.

I start with Twilight's first instruction (link-reveal:"\"Remove as much stimulation in your room\"")[==

Then I place myself in a chair, and relax (link-reveal:"\"Relax as much of your body as you can. Every muscle and inch of your body.\"")[==

I imagine my body relaxing into a warm bath. Every inch of my body relieving itself from the burden of holding tension as it's immersed into the fantasized body of water. (link:"My feet...")[==(link:"My legs...")[==(link:"My torso...")[==(link:"My arms and shoulders...")[==(link:"Even my jaw and eyebrows...")[==

All of them perfectly relaxed. Feeling weightless. Like my vessel hardly exists now, prepared for losing myself into the next step. (link-replace:"\"To create a mindspace...\"")[=="To create a mindspace."

According to Twilight, a mindspace is a kind of mental image of a space to exist and live in. A peaceful home made perfectly to my needs and specification, what would be called a "happy place" in a cliche visualization exercise. 

[[➥ I begin with a forest->the Mindspace]]


:: the Mindspace [Unification Meditation] {"position":"750,125","size":"100,100"}
I visualize a thick forest. Filled with pine trees, and a sparse underbrush. A creek echoes into the air along with the idle sounds of birds and insects. Singing to night, illuminated by countless stars and the beautiful moon watching over all.

(link-reveal:"However, it's still not appropriate for a domesticated Golden Retriever.")[==

I begin on a small clearing, within earshot of the nearby creek, and begin a shell of a small home. Lots of windows and skylights to help diminish the barrier between inside and out. The first thing I populate it with is a fireplace and a dog bed to curl up in next to it. 

I vaguely decorate the rest of the space with vague images of a kitchen, bathroom, hallways. It is unneeded as it is, and I instead (link-replace:"focus on the bedroom...")[==focus on the bedroom.

It seems... appropriate that I would attempt the next step within a metaphor for the most private part of my mind. 

I make my room as appealing a resting space as possible. So a wonderful place to start is a large canopy bed covered in fairy lights. I pop in a desk with an overly pink computer setup. As well as a few large potted plants and trees.

The next step is what causes me the most pause. [[➥ I have to inhabit this mindspace next...->Meeting]]
