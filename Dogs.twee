:: Introduction [Intro] {"position":"25,25","size":"100,100"}
When I was younger, I always wore long hair. At the time I just didn't care about haircuts so I avoided them. Just kept growing out my hair. Even if it kept getting in my eyes. (link-reveal:"I could still see though my hair")[==

Sure, it made my vision a little fuzzier. Made it harder to see my peripheral vision. But I just kept wearing it long because I didn't care about shorter hair. Eventually, I grew up and thought that meant cutting it off. (link-reveal:"But that bit of blindness remained no matter how short my hair got.")[==

I couldn't see certain things about myself. I couldn't see myself as smart enough to enjoy working with technology. I couldn't see myself talented enough to make art. It made me blind to how much I wanted to be a woman.

(link-reveal:"But most of all...")[==

[[➥ It made me think I was human->Walk in the Park]]

(link-reveal:"Some time ago, I was walking in a park. ")[=The sunlight's tingly warmth relaxes my very soul as (link-reveal:"I walk along this path.")[== 

After being cooped up indoors after such a long dark winter the smell of dirt and plants is incredibly cathartic. I even get shivers down my spine as the breeze (link-reveal:"rustles the leaves above me.")[==

But most of all, I get to exist outside. As myself. Outside. (link-reveal:"Walking along this gravel path.")[==

And appearing behind a bend I see the most incredible sight! (link-reveal:"Yellow fur, ")[==(link-reveal:"a black nose, ")[==(link-reveal:"four legs and paws, ")[==(link-reveal:"and a happy wagging tail.", (text-style:"sway"))[==

(link-reveal:"It's a golden retriever!", (text-colour:yellow))[==

I beam as I see the dog walk in my direction, as happy as they can be. So am I. I have to hold myself back from skipping towards them, say hi, and pet them. (link-replace:"I want to...")[==I want to, (link-replace:"but...")[==but people make me anxious. Like the one on the other end of their leash. (link-reveal:"So I just mind my business and try to look uninterested")[==

Soon the moment passes, as the dog and their owner pass by me.

The owner is forgotten, but I keep thinking about their dog. I think a refrain that keeps getting stuck in my head lately.

(link:"Suddenly, I flashed back to a memory from high school.")[==(box:"x")+(transition:"blur")[==I'm underneath the stairwell, the perfect space for hiding along with all of my friends who didn't like to be seen.

(link-reveal:"Goth was there too,")[== proselytizing the new Gundam Series. Convincing us to watch by showing how cool the mech designs of this series is. I never really cared about mechs or mechanical designs; so my deaf ears did their best to make their screeds futile.

Instead, I actually found my attention drifting towards (link-reveal:"Paige.")[== I... kinda had a crush on her. In retrospect, it was clearly a "I want to be her" crush. But then again, I still get crushes on artsy and nerdy types. You bet she was both too, considering she was the furry of the group. 

In an unusual act of boldness, I managed to gather the courage to ask her what she was working on. As usual it was her mouse OC, and started rambling about the adventure this sketch was portraying. I listened and nodded intently, trying to note details as if there was a test later about them. Until suddenly...

[[➥ "Do you have a fursona?"->Do you have a fursona?]]

Soon enough, she came back with a (link:"sketch.")[==

It was exactly what I wanted, a competent drawing of lithe and athletic wolfhound. Clad in a black leather jacket, and wielding a sword. I shouldn't have cared about it; I wasn't even a furry. (link-replace:"But...")[==But something about the sketch... The androgynous look, the long hair tied back into a ponytail, and how feral they looked. It made me smile in a genuine way that I couldn't back then.

(link-reveal:"I was proud of it")[==, and I showed Goth. They laughed at how edgy they looked, and I felt silly. But then asked what's my new OC's (link:"name...")[==name.

(link-replace:"Sunny...")[==(link-replace:"No that's a girly name.", (transition:"shudder"))[==Gold, the Wolfhound

I kept that sketch in my locker, proud that I had some art of my crush that they drew for me. But as time went on I slowly became more ashamed of it. Being a furry was childish. It's better to accept whom you are, more mature... (link-reveal:"but...")[== I couldn't bring myself to get rid of it, I couldn't look at it either. 

Instead I just hidden it away, slid away in with important documents. In an attempt to forget about it...

:: Identity Issues [Realizations] {"position":"25,550","size":"100,100"}
Though, in retrospect, realizing I was a dog was a larger shift for me than realizing my (link-reveal:"gender.")[==

In comparison, gender was easy. I could see a girl, and map myself onto her. I could look and act more like a girl, and it is (relatively) socially acceptable. Ultimately, I could give permission to myself to become more like a girl. 

But something other than human is much (link-reveal:"harder to grasp...")[==

Until that moment, I couldn't conceptually map a tail and muzzle onto me the same way I could with breasts. I couldn't act like a dog without people thinking I should be locked up. Fuck, I couldn't take drugs or wear clothes to look more like a dog! And people couldn't see me as a dog the same way they saw me as a woman(link:"...")[==.

It's been a rough couple of weeks since Goth made me aware of the term (link-repeat:"therian")[(dialog:"Basically, you identify strongly with another species that exists on earth.")]. Since then, I've been trying to explore what (link-reveal:"being a dog means to me.")[==

A consequence is that I've been visiting the park more often. It's what dogs enjoy, right? Going to the park.

Another Golden Retriever passes by me without incident. As ritual, I can't help but chant a painful refrain, "they'll never realize that (link-replace:"I'm a dog too...\"")[==I'm a dog too."

A question sneaks into my head; "if I'm a dog then (link-reveal:"what does it mean to be a dog?\"")[==

I think about the physical features of a dog; and how my body lacks them. What about the actions of a dog? Should I pant and walk on all fours? What about the thoughts of a dog? Can I think like a dog? All these questions create painful stabs of doubt, (link-reveal:"\"I'm not a dog...\"")[==

I keep trying to focus on the one reminder; the thing that acts as a reminder of what I am. What I look like in my mind's eye.

It's been easiest to think on my (link-repeat:"phantoms")[(dialog:"'Phantom' sensations of body parts you don't have. Things like cat ears, dragon tails, multiple arms.

Why do you think it's an Irish Wolfhound?

(link-replace:"Because I was them")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Because I was them, for a moment. A couple of weeks ago I was in the park and got spooked for some reason... and I took a look at my phantoms. But instead of the usual puppy I saw a wolfhound instead...

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Interesting... one more thing. Has this wolfhound talked to you directly?

(link-replace:"No")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
No. Not exactly. Just, expressing my anxieties and answering questions.

(link-replace:"So what is up with me?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
So what is up with me?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
To put it simply, you have two forms and you have to process some anxiety.
I have known some who have multiple concrete forms. Unlike radiant, who shifts fluidly between forms.

(transition:"fade-up")[==(text-colour:#f5376a)[AbandonedMallGoth]
So not a plural thing

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Exactly.

(link-replace:"Plural?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Plural?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Sorry. I should explain.
But first, are you familiar with Disassociative Identity Disorder; or what media calls "Multiple Personalities"?

(link-replace:"Um yes?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Um yes?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Plurality is an umbrella term for similar situations. Where two actors with agency exist within the same body.
Penumbra and myself are one such example. She is a close friend and a person whom I consider a kind of family.
I had a suspicion that this might be the case. However as it stands there is not enough to indicate that this is plurality.

(link-replace:"So what is it then???")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
So what is it then???

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
You said you inhabited your wolfhound form when you were scared. Right?

(link-replace:"Mhm")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Mhm

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Could be merely that you preferred a more intimidating form to protect yourself; and reverted when you were safe.

(transition:"fade-up")[==(text-colour:#f5376a)[AbandonedMallGoth]

It was a wolfhound too

:: Puppy in the Park [Realizations Park] {"position":"650,425","size":"100,100"}
(link-reveal:"So... I'm just a wolfhound sometimes,")[== is a thought that nags at me as I circle the park once again...

It's been unsatisfying. Just having this part of me that's caused distress to be just a coping mechanism.

But on the other hand it means I'm flexible with who I am! Some days I can feel like a cute fluffy puppy! But others I'm a wolf who protects themselves from (link-reveal:"the world!")[==

Focusing on that last word reminds me, to once again meditate on the world as I walk through the park...

(link:"I smell the dirt and ichor of the plants... ")[==(link:"I hear the leaves dancing and the birds singing...")[==(link:"I feel the dirt and gravel shift under my paws...")[==And I feel my ears, twitching with sounds, my tail swaying with each step, and my muzzle on the front of my face.

All of them golden and fluffy...

I haven't felt the wolfhound form, or heard it talk, in the days since I talked with Twilight. Another aspect of that anti-climax. I suppose that I haven't needed a strong form as I have gotten more comfortable in my skin. Likewise haven't felt as anxious or scared since either...

(link-reveal:"Since I'm a happy little puppy after all!")[==

Talking on Frogs has made it more comfortable to embrace aspects of myself. I've picked up mannerisms from 🐶, and have gotten lots of validating headpats and belly rubs from the group there!

I've even ordered a set of ears and a collar to help me feel more like a puppy in my skin!

At the moment though, I'm just pretending to be human. (link-reveal:"I'm doing a pretty dang good job looking the part too!")[== 

The folks on Frogs have helped a lot with my transition and presentation. I learned a lot about makeup from Twilight and company. 🐶 helped with finding flattering clothes that make me look like I actually have curves. I feel like I'm no longer flailing trying to look like a woman.

A thought strikes me when [[➥ I see a bathroom up ahead->the Bathroom]]

It all goes quiet. The thoughts, the anxiety, the panic attack. 

(link-reveal:"Until a stall door opens and slams")[==

I sink into the toilet, calming as (link-reveal:"I ground myself.")[==

(link:"I smell the cleaning chemicals lingering in this bathroom... ")[==(link:"I hear the steady drip of a leaking faucet...")[==(link:"I feel my claws gripping into my leg...")[==And I feel my ears standing alert, my tail hanging off the edge of the toilet, and my muzzle bearing fangs.

All covered in wiry hair, hanging off of a lanky and very tall body.

(link-reveal:"I'm a wolfhound.")[== I'm strong. I'm brave. And it is her who is trespassing on my territory. But I shall wait until it is (link:"safe.")[==

(link:"I listen to her flush a nearby toilet.")[==(link:"Slam the door once more.")[==(link:"Wash her hands at the sink.")[==(link:"Then walk out.")[==(link-reveal:"And then I am alone once more.")[==

I work on instinct, quickly finishing up and cleaning before anybody else has a chance to sneak up on me. Before leaving.

The second I return to the safety of the park, I nearly collapse. I am drained and exhausted by that aborted panic attack. I force myself back home, retreating to my den to recover. But still as I walk I can't help but contemplate on those words that popped into my head.

"I'll take over"

But here is [[➥ one more thing->Meditation]] I would suggest.
]]


:: Meditation [Unification Meditation] {"position":"575,50","size":"100,100"}
I close the curtains in my room. Make it as dark as possible. I put on some rhythmless new age music.

I start with Twilight's first instruction (link-reveal:"\"Remove as much stimulation in your room\"")[==

Then I place myself in a chair, and relax (link-reveal:"\"Relax as much of your body as you can. Every muscle and inch of your body.\"")[==

I imagine my body relaxing into a warm bath. Every inch of my body relieving itself from the burden of holding tension as it's immersed into the fantasized body of water. (link:"My feet...")[==(link:"My legs...")[==(link:"My torso...")[==(link:"My arms and shoulders...")[==(link:"Even my jaw and eyebrows...")[==

All of them perfectly relaxed. Feeling weightless. Like my vessel hardly exists now, prepared for losing myself into the next step. (link-replace:"\"To create a mindspace...\"")[=="To create a mindspace."

According to Twilight, a mindspace is a kind of mental image of a space to exist and live in. A peaceful home made perfectly to my needs and specification, what would be called a "happy place" in a cliche visualization exercise. 

[[➥ I begin with a forest->the Mindspace]]


:: the Mindspace [Unification Meditation] {"position":"575,150","size":"100,100"}
I visualize a thick forest. Filled with pine trees, and a sparse underbrush. A creek echoes into the air along with the idle sounds of birds and insects. Singing to night, illuminated by countless stars and the beautiful moon watching over all.

(link-reveal:"However, it's still not appropriate for a domesticated Golden Retriever.")[==

I begin on a small clearing, within earshot of the nearby creek, and begin a shell of a small home. Lots of windows and skylights to help diminish the barrier between inside and out. The first thing I populate it with is a fireplace and a dog bed to curl up in next to it. 

I vaguely decorate the rest of the space with vague images of a kitchen, bathroom, hallways. It is unneeded as it is, and I instead (link-replace:"focus on the bedroom...")[==focus on the bedroom.

It seems... appropriate that I would attempt the next step within a metaphor for the most private part of my mind. 

I make my room as appealing a resting space as possible; so a wonderful place to start is a large canopy bed covered in fairy lights. I pop in a desk with an overly pink computer setup. As well as a few large potted plants and trees.

The next step is what causes me the most pause. [[➥ I have to inhabit this mindspace next...->Inhabiting]]

Our theory is that we have two different roles in regard to ourself. That Gold's purpose was to keep us safe, act as a protector, and watch out for danger. Meanwhile Sunny was responsible for helping us reach out and help us express ourself more openly.

:: One last walk {"position":"800,275","size":"100,100"}
(link-reveal:"Sunlight. ", (text-colour:#ffe066))[==It's tingly warmth relaxes our very soul as (link-reveal:"we walk through this park!", (text-colour:"yellow"))[== 

Our walks have become the perfect time for us to talk now! We talk about people! The people we like! Drama on Twitter! Each other! lots of stuffs!

But likewise it's made us prone to contemplation. Thinking about complicated things. Like... (link-reveal:"my gender. ", (text-colour:#ffe066))[==

It's easier figuring out that I'm a dog than my fucking gender. I'm a wolfhound, that was so easy I could figure it out in high school. But what the hell kinda gender I have is just... complicated. Doesn't help that gender is a concept created by humans, and I'm not one. Even if that was hard for us to admit a while ago.

(link-reveal:"But I made easier for you to be a dog! ", (text-colour:#ffe066))[==I've been forcing Gold to finally dress like the goth pup they are! It's helped them feel more comfy wearing their collar outside! Plus they feel intimidating! Plus we learned some hair buns that make us feel like we got ears! 

(link-replace:"Still...", (text-colour:#ffe066))[==Still, I have no clue how to map a gender like me. At least with Sunny she's happy being a "good girl" or whatever. Me? It feels like my gender is just "dog" and how the heck do I map that onto me?

(link-reveal:"Gold! Look out!", (text-colour:"yellow"))[==

...and appearing behind a bend we see the most heavenly sight. (link-reveal:"Yellow fur, ")[==(link-reveal:"a black nose, ")[==(link-reveal:"four legs (each ending in paws), ")[==(link-reveal:"and a happy wagging tail.", (text-style:"sway"))[==

(link-reveal:"It's a golden retriever.")[==

We beam as I see the dog walk in our direction. As happy as they can be. Our gaze is transfixed. Just watching the goldie come closer, (link-reveal:"until...")[==

They dart towards us and starts sniffing us, with an excited wagging tail! Their owner shouts an embarrassed, "sorry!" Trying to drag the dog away! But they're too transfixed with our scent. (link-reveal:"We give a brief glance to the person at the other end of the leash.")[== (link-reveal:"//Oh//", (text-colour:#ffe066))[== they're a fucking hot enby with blue hair, wearing a denim jacket covered in pride pins, and a collar around their neck too.

"Oh, she's not usually this friendly with people." 

(link-reveal:"We should ask to pet her!", (text-colour:"yellow"))[==
(link-reveal:"Gah... gay...", (text-colour:#ffe066))[==
(link-reveal:"Okay you useless lesbian!", (text-colour:"yellow"))[==

(link-reveal:"\"Um, is it okay if I pet her?\"", (text-colour:"yellow"))[== We asked.

"Oh, of course. She really seems to like you. She's usually only this friendly with dogs!"

Oh my god [[➥ she can tell...->Final Title]]
