:: Introduction [Intro] {"position":"0,0","size":"100,100"}
Dysphoria is kinda hell of a drug.

It makes an extremely effective downer. So good I kinda couldn't feel anything for like 13 years. Plus! It tends to have a lot of reality altering effects!

Like making me blind to how I am a girl, or making me think I didn't enjoy or was smart enough to work with computers. Also, how... well...

(link-reveal:"Sunlight. ")[=It's tingly warmth relaxes my very soul as I walk through this (link-reveal:"park.")[== 

The smell of plants and dirt is heavenly after a long dark winter keeping me cooped up indoors. I get shivers down my spine as I heard the leaves rustling in the (link-reveal:"trees.")[==

The harmony of the leaves makes a bassline to accompany the bird calls dancing in the air. All driven by the bassline of my feet crunching the gravel on this (link-reveal:"path.")[==

And appearing behind a bend I see the most heavenly sight. (link-reveal:"Yellow fur, ")[==(link-reveal:"a black nose, ")[==(link-reveal:"four legs (each ending in paws), ")[==(link-reveal:"and a happy wagging tail.", (text-style:"sway"))[==

(link-reveal:"It's a golden retriever.")[==

But the moment passes, as the dog and their owner pass by me.

The moment is clouded by the same thought I always have with moments like these.

(link-reveal:"Goth was there too,")[== proselytizing the new Gundam Series. Convincing us to watch by showing how cool the mech designs of this series is. I never really cared about mechs or mechanical designs; so my deaf ears did their best to make their screeds futile.

Instead, I actually found my attention drifting towards (link-reveal:"Paige.")[== I... kinda had a crush on her. In retrospect, it was clearly a "I want to be her" crush. But then again, I still get crushes on artsy and nerdy types. You bet she was both too, considering she was the furry of the group. 

In an unusual act of boldness, I managed to gather the courage to ask her what she was working on. As usual it was her mouse OC, and started rambling about the adventure this sketch was portraying. I listened and nodded intently, trying to note details as if there was a test later about them. Until suddently...

[[➥ "Do you have a fursona?"->Do you have a fursona?]]

Soon enough, she came back with a (link:"sketch.")[==

(link-replace:"But...")[==But something about the sketch... The androgynous look, the long hair tied back into a ponytail, and how feral they looked.

(link-replace:"Sunny...")[==(link-replace:"No that's a girly name.", (transition:"shudder"))[==Gold, the Wolfhound

I kept that sketch in my locker, proud that I had some art of my crush that they drew for me. But as time went on I slowly became more ashamed of it. Being a furry was childish. It's better to accept whom you are, more mature... (link-reveal:"but...")[== I couldn't bring myself to get rid of it, I couldn't look at it either. 

Instead I just hidden it away, slid away in with important documents. In an attempt to forget about it...

:: Identity Issues [Realizations] {"position":"0,525","size":"100,100"}
Though, in retrospect, realizing I was a dog was a larger shift for me than realizing my (link-reveal:"gender.")[==

In comparison, gender was easy. I could see a girl, and map myself onto her. I could look and act more like a girl, and it is (relatively) socially acceptable. Ultimately, I could give permission to myself to become more like a girl. 

But something other than human is much (link-reveal:"harder to grasp...")[==

Until that moment, I couldn't conceptually map a tail and muzzle onto me the same way I could with breasts. I couldn't act like a dog without people thinking I should be locked up. Fuck, I couldn't take drugs or wear clothes to look more like a dog! And people couldn't see me as a dog the same way they saw me as a woman(link:"...")[==.

It's been a rough couple of weeks since Goth made me aware of the term (link-repeat:"therian")[(dialog:"Basically, you identify strongly with another species that exists on earth.")]. Since then, I've been trying to explore what (link-reveal:"being a dog means to me.")[==

A consequence is that I've been visiting the park more often. It's what dogs enjoy, right? Going to the park.

Another Golden Retriever passes by me without incident. As ritual, I can't help but chant a painful refrain, "they'll never realize that (link-replace:"I'm a dog too...\"")[==I'm a dog too."

A question sneaks into my head; "if I'm a dog then (link-reveal:"what does it mean to be a dog?\"")[==

I think about the physical features of a dog; and how my body lacks them. What about the actions of a dog? Should I pant and walk on all fours? What about the thoughts of a dog? Can I think like a dog? All these questions create painful stabs of doubt, (link-reveal:"\"I'm not a dog...\"")[==

I keep trying to focus on the one reminder; the thing that acts as a reminder of what I am. What I look like in my mind's eye.

It's been easiest to think on my (link-repeat:"phantoms")[(dialog:"'Phantom' sensations of body parts you don't have. Things like cat ears, dragon tails, multiple arms.

(transition:"fade-up")[==(text-colour:#ae6113)[I'm 🐶!]
Our new puppy friend has an issue with a second doggy inside them making things rough :(

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Penumbra | Light System]
oh okies twi should help her then

(link:"Uh... what?")[==\
(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Hello.
I wish that we met under better circumstances.
But regardless, it seems that you are in a bit of a tricky situation.

(link-replace:"Um Hi?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Um Hi? Sorry who are you?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
I am a friend. Penumbra has stepped away so that I can talk instead.

(link-replace:"So, um, like a friend of Penny's?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
So, um, like a friend of Penny's? And you're borrowing her account?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
More akin to family, but that's an accurate assement.
I would like to ask about this wolfhound you mentioned.
Has it ever talked?

(link-replace:"Kinda? More like intrusive thoughts.")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Kinda, more like intrusive thoughts...

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Can you give an example of what these intrusive thoughts sounded like?

(link-replace:"Hm... it answered questions before me.")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Hm... it answered questions before me. Which I corrected immediately afterwards.

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
What sort of questions were these?

(link-replace:"Questions about what I looked like.")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Questions about what I looked like. Specifically the questions 🐶 was asking when I introduced myself here.
(link-replace:"Answering before I could...")[==Answering them before I could think, and it got more upset as I corrected myself.

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Why do you think it's an Irish Wolfhound?

(link-replace:"Because I was them")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Because I was them, for a moment. A couple of weeks ago I was in the park and got spooked for some reason... and I took a look at my phantoms. But instead of the usual puppy I saw a wolfhound instead...

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Interesting... one more thing. Has this wolfhound talked to you directly?

(link-replace:"No")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
No. Not exactly. Just, expressing my anxieties and answering questions.

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Hm. 
I see.

(link-replace:"So what is up with me?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
So what is up with me?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
To put it simply, you have two forms and you have to process some anxiety.
I have known some who have multiple concrete forms. Unlike radient, who shifts fluidly between forms.

(transition:"fade-up")[==(text-colour:#f5376a)[AbandonedMallGoth]
So not a plural thing

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Exactly.

(link-replace:"Plural?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Plural?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Sorry. I should explain.
But first, are you familiar with Dissasociative Identity Disorder; or what media calls "Multiple Personalities"?

(link-replace:"Um yes?")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Um yes?

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Plurality is an umbrella term for similar situations. Where two actors with agency exist within the same body.
Penumbra and myself are one such example. Penumbra is a younger sister to me whom just happens to coexist with me inside my head.
I had a suspicion that this might be the case. However as it stands there is not enough to indicate that this is plurality.

(link-replace:"So what is it then???")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
So what is it then???

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
You said you inhabited your wolfhound form when you were scared. Right?

(link-replace:"Mhm")[==(text-colour:yellow)[Sunny the Puppy (she/her)]
Mhm

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Could be merely that you preferred a more intimidating form to protect yourself; and reverted when you were safe.

(transition:"fade-up")[==(text-colour:#f5376a)[AbandonedMallGoth]
Weird thing though
Sunny's old fursona back when we were in high school
It was a wolfhound too

(transition:"fade-up")+(text-colour:#c6ced9)[Twilight | Light System]
Oh.
Still.
I don't think that Sunny is plural like I am.
