When I was younger, I always wore long hair. At the time I just didn't care about haircuts so I avoided them. I just kept growing out my hair, even if it kept getting in my eyes. (link-reveal:"I could still see through my hair after all.")[==

Sure, it made my sight a little fuzzier. It got harder to see things in my peripheral vision. But I just kept wearing it long because I didn't care for shorter hair. Eventually, I grew up and figured that meant cutting it off. (link-reveal:"But that bit of blindness remained no matter how short my hair got.")[==

I couldn't see certain things about myself. I couldn't see myself as "smart" enough to enjoy working with technology. I couldn't see myself as talented enough to make art. I couldn't see how much I wanted to be a woman.

(link-reveal:"But most of all...")[==

The sun's tingly warmth relaxes my soul as (link-reveal:"I walk in the park.")[== 

After being cooped up indoors for such a long dark winter the smell of dirt and plants is incredibly cathartic. I get shivers down my spine as the breeze (link-reveal:"rustles the leaves above me.")[==

But existing as myself, outside the house. It's an existence so utterly mundane and yet so free. (link-reveal:"Thats what raises my spirits the highest.")[==

And appearing from behind a bend I see the most incredible sight! (link-reveal:"Yellow fur, ")[==(link-reveal:"a black nose, ")[==(link-reveal:"four legs and four paws, ")[==(link-reveal:"and a happy wagging tail.", (text-style:"sway"))[==

(link-reveal:"It's a golden retriever!", (text-colour:yellow))[==

I beam as I see the dog trotting over towards me, as happy as they can be. Just like I am. I have to hold myself back from skipping over too, saying hi and petting them - (link-replace:"I want to...")[==I want to, (link-replace:"but...")[==but people make me anxious. Like the person on the other end of the leash. (link-reveal:"So I just mind my business and try to look uninterested.")[==

Soon the moment passes, as the dog and their owner pass by.

The owner is forgotten, but I keep thinking about their dog. I think a refrain that keeps getting stuck in my head lately.

(link:"➥ Continue", (text-color:grey)+(text-size:0.75)+(hover-style:(text-style:"Underline")))[==\
My difficulty processing and understanding myself is a chronic and dire issue. Like even figuring out my gender was a long and drawn out process. For the longest time as a kid I didn't really "get" gender and just kinda ignored it and did my own thing. 

(link-reveal:"At least until the world wouldn't let me.")[==

(link-reveal:"But I guess in some ways I had some //no signs™// moments back when I was a kid.")[== I liked being friends with girls more than boys. I was envious of girl's clothes. Heck, I even fantasized about being a girl in a few embarrassing private moments. 

(link-reveal:"But I never listened to those signs.")[== Heck, only a couple years ago I saw solid and undeniable proof I could be a hot and attractive trans woman. I even said, in that moment, "//I// could look like that," before trying to bury those feelings deep. I fought hard against that first crack in my egg - it took over a year before I came to accept it. 

(link-reveal:"Accepting I'm a dog felt even harder.")[== I could grasp and map myself onto a feminine body. A feminine **human** body. But a dog was a whole different ballpark. Like, I don't even know what having a tail feels like; or what it would be like to have floppy ears. (link-reveal:"Let alone acting or looking more like a dog.")[==

I can't exactly get acceptance and permission from others to act more like a dog. Let alone give it to myself.

Plus, unlike my gender, (link-reveal:"there were genuinely no signs!")[== [[Well, except maybe my fursona...->High School]]

I'm underneath the stairwell, the perfect space for hiding along with all of my other friends who didn't like to be seen.

(link-reveal:"I was ignoring Goth as usual,")[== who was recruiting us to watch the new Gundam series by showing off how cool the new mech designs were. I never really cared for mechanical designs; so my selectively deaf ears did their best to make their propaganda futile.

Instead, I actually found my attention (link-reveal:"drifting towards Paige.")[== I... kinda had a crush on her. In retrospect, it was clearly a "I want to be her" crush. But then again, I still get crushes on artsy and nerdy types. You bet she was both too, considering she was the furry of the group.

(link-reveal:"I managed to gather the courage to Approach Paige.")[== It was uncharacteristic of me, especially back then. I was always anxious around people, doubly so around those I liked. 

(link-reveal:"\"So, what are you working on?\"")[== I asked her. My crush immediately started to ramble about her new mouse OC that she was drawing; and elaborated on an adventure that this new sketch was a snapshot of. I listened and nodded intently, trying to make mental notes of each detail, as if I was going to be quizzed about them later. 

Then suddenly she asked, [[➥ "What's your fursona?"->What's your fursona?]]


:: What's your fursona? [Realizations High-School] {"position":"150,650","size":"100,100"}
"What's your fursona?" Paige asked.

(link-replace:"\"Oh! I like dogs!\"", (text-colour:yellow))[==\

[[➥ "Okay! I'll draw him up real quick!"->the Wolfhound]]


:: the Wolfhound [Realizations High-School] {"position":"150,750","size":"100,100"}
Soon enough, (link-reveal:"she came back with a sketch.")[==

It was exactly what I wanted, a competent drawing of a lithe and athletic wolfhound. Clad in a black leather jacket, and wielding a sword. I shouldn't have cared about it; I wasn't even a furry. (link-replace:"But...")[==(link-reveal:"But there was something about the sketch...")[==

The androgynous look, the long hair tied back into a ponytail, and how feral they seemed. It made me smile in a genuine way that I couldn't back then. (link-reveal:"I...")[==

(link-reveal:"I was proud of it.", (text-color:"#c9ad7d"))[== Proud that I received a gift from my crush. I excitedly went up and showed Goth. Who immediately asked, (link-reveal:"\"What's their name?\"")[==

(link-replace:"Gold.", (text-color:"#c9ad7d"))[==(link-reveal:"Gold, the Wolfhound")[==

"Yo, they sound like an edgelord dude. You hiding some edge sis?" Goth joked. I didn't reply. Something like shame started boiling viscerally inside me.

I hid that sketch in my locker. But as time went on I slowly became more ashamed of it. Being a furry is childish; it's better and more mature (link-reveal:"to accept reality than fantasy...")[== (link-replace:"But...")[==But I couldn't bring myself to get rid of it, even though I couldn't look at it either. 

So instead I hid it away, leaving it sandwiched between unimportant documents in a yellow binder. An attempt to forget about it...

It's been a rough couple of weeks since Goth made me aware of the term (link-repeat:"therian")[(dialog:"Someone who identifies with another animal species from earth.")]. Since then, I've been trying to explore what (link-reveal:"being a dog means to me.")[==

The rustling plants make my floppy ears twitch, and earthy smells seem to tug gently at my snout. I can't touch them, but for some reason I can't help but feel my doglike features' presence -Sometimes they feel even more **there** than my human features.

Likewise another consequence is that I've been visiting the park more often. After all, dogs love going to the park. I guess I do too, since I feel my (text-style:"sway")[tail] wagging.

Another Golden Retriever passes by me without incident. As is ritual, I can't help but chant a painful refrain, "they'll never realize that (link-replace:"I'm a dog too...\"")[==I'm a dog too."

On this occasion though, a question sneaks into my head; "if I'm a dog then (link-reveal:"what does it mean to be a dog?\"")[==

Well, there's the physical features of a dog: tails, ears, a muzzle, paws. None of which I actually have... What about the actions of a dog? Should I pant and walk on all fours? Think like a dog? Is it even possible to? All these questions make me wonder, (link-reveal:"\"How the heck am I a dog...\"")[==

(link-reveal:"\"I'm just a human.\"")[==

Somehow the admission stings. Just like if I was called a man. I try to pull my attention elsewhere in self-preservation. I close my eyes and focus on what makes me inhuman, [[my phantoms.->Puppy Phantoms]]

"I'm a Golden Retriever, right?" I ask myself in one of my daily walks around the park. It's been good for contemplating and thinking, but I haven't been able to process what happened in the Midnight Society any further. (link-reveal:"Maybe I should just try and drop it...")[==

My anxiety and dysphoria grows as I try to rush forwards. Trying my hardest to ignore the manifestation of judgment walking towards me.

(link-reveal:"\"So... I'm just a wolfhound sometimes,\"")[== the thought keeps nagging at me as I circle the park once again...

It's been unsatisfying. Just having this part of me that's caused distress to be just a coping mechanism.

But on the other hand it means I'm flexible with who I am! Some days I can feel like a cute fluffy puppy! But other days I'm a big strong wolf who can protect herself from (link-reveal:"the world!")[==

Focusing on that last word reminds me, to once again meditate on the world as I walk through the park...

(link-reveal:"I smell the dirt and perfume of the plants... ")[==(link-reveal:"I hear the leaves dancing and the birds singing... ")[==(link-reveal:"I feel the dirt and gravel shift under my paws... ")[==And I feel my ears, twitching with sounds, my (text-style:"sway")[tail swaying] with each step, and my muzzle on the front of my face.

All of them golden and fluffy...

I haven't felt the wolfhound form, or heard it talk, in the days since I talked with Twilight. Another aspect of that anti-climax. I suppose that I haven't needed a strong form as I have gotten more comfortable in my skin. Likewise I haven't felt as anxious or scared since either...

(link-reveal:"Since I'm a happy little puppy after all!")[==

Talking to the Midnight Society has made it more comfortable to embrace aspects of myself. I've picked up mannerisms from 🐶, and have gotten lots of validating headpats and belly rubs from the group there!

I've even ordered a set of ears and a collar to help me feel more like a puppy in my body!

At the moment though, I'm just pretending to be human. (link-reveal:"I'm doing a pretty dang good job looking the part too!")[== 

Talking to the Midnight Society have helped a lot with my transition and presentation. I learned a lot about makeup from Twilight and company. 🐶 helped with finding flattering clothes that make me look like I actually have curves. I feel like I'm no longer flailing trying to look like a woman.

A thought strikes me when (link-reveal:"I see a bathroom up ahead.")[== "I feel amazing! I look amazing! I think I can do it. (t8n-depart:"instant")+(t8n-arrive:"dissolve")[[➥ "I'm finally going to use the ladies room!"->the Bathroom]]

(link:"➥ Continue", (text-color:grey)+(text-size:0.75)+(hover-style:(text-style:"Underline")))[==\
I close the curtains in my room. Make it as dark as possible. I put on some rhythmless new age music.

I start with Twilight's first instruction (link-reveal:"\"Remove as much stimulation in your room as you can\"")[==

Then I place myself in a chair, and relax (link-reveal:"\"Relax as much of your body as you can. Every muscle and inch.\"")[==

I imagine my body relaxing into a warm bath. Every inch of my body relieving itself from the burden of holding tension as it's immersed into the fantasized body of water.(link:" My feet...")[==(link:" My legs...")[==(link:" My torso...")[==(link:" My arms and shoulders...")[==(link:" Even my jaw and eyebrows...")[==..

Every part of my body perfectly relaxed. Feeling weightless. Like my body hardly exists now, prepared for losing myself into the next step. (link-replace:"\"To create a 'mindspace'...\"")[=="To create a mindspace."

According to Twilight, a mindspace is a kind of mental image of a space to exist and live in. A peaceful home made perfectly to my needs and specification, what would be called a "happy place" in a cliche visualization exercise. 

[[➥ I begin with a forest->the Mindspace]]


:: the Mindspace [Unification Meditation] {"position":"575,150","size":"100,100"}
(change: ?page, (background:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corlesss/dogs_story/main/dist/img/night%20forest.jpg")+(t8n:"blur"))\
I visualize a thick forest. Filled with pine trees, and a sparse underbrush. A creek echoes into the air along with the idle sounds of birds and insects. Singing into night, illuminated by countless stars and the beautiful moon watching over all.

(link-reveal:"It's beautiful, however, it's not yet appropriate for a domesticated Golden Retriever.")[==
(change: ?page, (background:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corlesss/dogs_story/main/dist/img/night%20cabin.jpg")+(t8n:"dissolve"))\

I begin visualising a small clearing, within earshot of the nearby creek, and imagine a shell of a small home. Lots of windows and skylights to help diminish the barrier between inside and out. (link-reveal:"The first thing inside is a fireplace ")[==

(change: ?page, (background:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corlesss/dogs_story/main/dist/img/night%20fireplace.jpeg")+(t8n:"dissolve"))\
And next to the fireplace is a dog bed to curl up in. I vaguely decorate the rest of the space with vague impressions of a kitchen, bathroom, hallways. It is unneeded as it is, and I instead (link-replace:"focus on the bedroom in the loft...")[==\
(change: ?page, (background:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corlesss/dogs_story/main/dist/img/night%20bedroom.jpg")+(t8n:"dissolve"))\
focus on the bedroom in the loft.

It seems... appropriate that I would attempt the next step within a metaphor for the most private part of my mind. 

I make my room as comfortable a resting space as possible; a cozy little bed illuminated by fairy lights hung across the ceiling. A closet filled with affirming clothes. A tiny desk with a small, humming computer.

The next step is what causes me the most pause. [[➥ I have to inhabit this space next...->Inhabiting]]

:: Conversation with Myself [Unification Meditation Bedroom] {"position":"675,150","size":"100,100"}
We talked for a long time. It was... odd... like old friends who hadn't seen each other in ages. But those friends shared thoughts and memories seamlessly.

We talked about a lot. (link-reveal:"How odd it was that we called each other girlfriend so quickly. ",(text-color:"#c9ad7d"))[==(link-reveal:"How natural it feels to call each other girlfriends! ", (text-color:"yellow"))[==(link-reveal:"What makes us feel different from one another. ",(text-color:"#c9ad7d"))[==(link-reveal:"What we're each attracted to! ", (text-color:"yellow"))[==(link-reveal:"But most of all how we coexist. ",(text-color:"#c9ad7d"))[==

Our theory is that we have two different roles in regard to ourself. That Gold's purpose was to keep us safe, act as a protector, and watch out for danger. Meanwhile Sunny was responsible for helping us reach out and help us express ourself more openly. 

(link-reveal:"We also tried to puzzle out how long each of us have been here...", (text-color:"yellow"))[==

It feels, in a sense, that we have always both been around. From high school we distinctly remember moments involving the two of us. But likewise, we felt very intertwined in personality. But our dog forms just created enough cognitive dissonance to cause fracturing; and cause us to finally split.

(link-replace:"But after all that talk...")[==But after all that talk we just held each other, in the innermost space of our mind. In our bedroom. Gripping tight, and being safe and vulnerable. Cuddling, much the way a pair of dogs would. [[➥ We laied there until we passed out...->Coming Out]]

Our walks have become the perfect time for us to talk now! We talk about people! The people we like! Drama on Twitter! Each other! lots of stuffs!

But likewise it's made us prone to contemplation. Thinking about complicated things. Like... (link-reveal:"my gender. ", (text-colour:#ffe066))[==

Honestly, it was easier figuring out that I'm a dog than my fucking gender. I'm a wolfhound, that was so easy (link-repeat:"I could figure it out in high school.", (text-colour:#ffe066))[(text-color:yellow)(dialog:"Yet you were too much of a coward that you gave up on that as soon as somebody made fun of you. :P")] But what the hell kinda gender I have is just... complicated. Doesn't help that gender is a concept created by humans, and I'm not a human. Even if that was hard for us to admit not that ago.

(link-reveal:"But I made it easier for you to be a dog! ", (text-colour:yellow))[==I've been forcing Gold to finally dress like the goth pup they are!

(link-replace:"Still...", (text-colour:#ffe066))[==Still, I have no clue how to map a gender like me. At least with Sunny she's happy being a girl or whatever. Me? It feels like my gender is just "dog" and how the heck do I map that onto me?
